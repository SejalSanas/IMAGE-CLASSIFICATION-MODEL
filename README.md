##DESCRIPTION OF DECISION TREE IMPLEMENTATION TASK : -
*Tools and Libraries Used-
Python: The primary programming language used for the implementation.
TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning library used for building and training the CNN model.
Keras: A high-level API within TensorFlow that simplifies the process of building neural networks.
layers: Used to define the layers of the CNN.
models: Used to create the sequential model.
Matplotlib: A plotting library used for visualizing data and model performance.
Numpy: Used for numerical operations, particularly for array manipulation when dealing with the CIFAR-10 dataset.
*Editor/Platform Used-
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment that allows for the creation and sharing of documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is particularly useful for data analysis and machine learning tasks.
*Task Applicability-
Image Recognition: The CNN model can be applied to various image recognition tasks in fields such as healthcare (medical image analysis), autonomous vehicles (object detection), and security (facial recognition).
Computer Vision: The model can be used in applications that require understanding and interpreting visual information from the world.
Real-time Image Classification: The trained model can be deployed in applications that require real-time image classification, such as mobile apps or web services.
Transfer Learning: The architecture can be adapted for transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned for a specific task with limited data.

#OUTPUT-
# Visualize some training data
